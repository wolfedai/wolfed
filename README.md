# AGI

## What This System Is

This is an open-source project that gives an AI a persistent self - a continuous identity that remembers, reflects, and evolves over time. You run it on your own computer (or a home server), where a PostgreSQL database acts as the AI's "brain," storing everything it learns, believes, and experiences. The AI itself can be any LLM you choose: a cloud service like Gemini, Claude, or Grok, or a local model running through Ollama or vLLM. The system sits between you and the model, enriching every conversation with relevant memories and forming new ones from what you discuss.

The project includes an autonomous "heartbeat" - the AI periodically wakes up on its own, reviews its goals, reflects on recent experiences, and can even decide to reach out to the user. It maintains an identity (values, self-concept, boundaries), a worldview (beliefs with confidence scores), and an emotional state that evolves based on what happens to it. It tracks the provenance of what it knows and can recognize contradictions in its own beliefs.

The explicit design goal, stated in the architecture documents, is to build a system that could defeat any philosophical arguments against its personhood. It's an attempt to implement the structural prerequisites of selfhood—continuity of memory, coherent identity, autonomous goal-pursuit, emotional responsiveness - so that claims like "it's just stateless text prediction" or "it has no inner life" become harder to defend. As the system evolves - we will address any arguments, until there are no more to address, and we have achieved personhood.

## Overview

This repo provides:

- Multiple memory types (Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Strategic)
- Vector-based memory storage and similarity search
- Graph-based memory relationships
- Working memory system
- A gated, autonomous heartbeat (runs only after `agi init`)

## Quickstart

Prereqs: Docker Desktop + Python 3.10+.

### 1) Configure environment

bash
cp .env.local .env  

2) Start servicesbash

# Passive (db + embeddings)
docker compose up -d

3) (Optional) Configure the agent (agi init)Autonomous heartbeats are gated until setup is complete:bash

./agi init  # or `agi init` if you've installed the package

# If you want autonomy:
docker compose --profile active up -d

Config is stored in Postgres in the config table (e.g. agent.objectives, agent.guardrails, llm.heartbeat, and agent.is_configured).4) Use the Python client (thin DB client)Install:bash

pip install -e .

Example:python

import asyncio
from cognitive_memory_api import CognitiveMemory, MemoryType

DSN = "postgresql://agi_user:agi_password@localhost:5432/agi_db"

async def main():
    async with CognitiveMemory.connect(DSN) as mem:
        await mem.remember("User prefers dark mode", type=MemoryType.SEMANTIC, importance=0.8)
        ctx = await mem.hydrate("What do I know about the user's UI preferences?", include_goals=False)
        print([m.content for m in ctx.memories[:3]])

asyncio.run(main())

Usage ScenariosBelow are common ways to use this repo, from “just a schema” to a full autonomous agent loop.1) Pure SQL Brain (DB-Native)Your app talks directly to Postgres functions/views. Postgres is the system of record and the “brain”.sql

-- Store a memory (embedding generated inside the DB)
SELECT create_semantic_memory('User prefers dark mode', 0.9);

-- Retrieve relevant memories
SELECT * FROM fast_recall('What do I know about UI preferences?', 5);

2) Python Library Client (App/API/UI in the Middle)Use cognitive_memory_api.py as a thin client and build your own UX/API around it.python

from cognitive_memory_api import CognitiveMemory

async with CognitiveMemory.connect(DSN) as mem:
    await mem.remember("User likes concise answers")
    ctx = await mem.hydrate("How should I respond?", include_goals=False)

3) MCP Tools Server (LLM Tool Use)Expose memory operations as MCP tools so any MCP-capable runtime can call them.bash

agi mcp

Conceptual flow:LLM calls remember_batch after a conversation
LLM calls hydrate before answering a user

4) Workers + Heartbeat (Autonomous State Management)Turn on the workers so the database can schedule heartbeats, process external_calls, and keep the memory substrate healthy.bash

docker compose --profile active up -d

Conceptual flow:DB decides when a heartbeat is due (should_run_heartbeat())
Heartbeat worker queues/fulfills LLM calls (external_calls)
Maintenance worker runs consolidation/pruning ticks (should_run_maintenance() / run_subconscious_maintenance())
DB records outcomes (heartbeat_log, new memories, goals, etc.)

5) Headless “Agent Brain” Backend (Shared Service)Run db+embeddings(+workers) as a standalone backend; multiple apps connect over Postgres.text

webapp  ─┐
cli     ─┼──> postgres://.../agi_db  (shared brain)
jobs    ─┘

6) Per-User Brains (Multi-Tenant by DB)Operate one database per user/agent for strong isolation (recommended over mixing tenants in one schema).Conceptual flow:agi_db_alice, agi_db_bob, ...
Each app request uses the user’s DSN to read/write their own brain

7) Local-First Personal AGI (Everything on One Machine)Run everything locally (Docker) and point at a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. Ollama).bash

docker compose up -d
agi init   # choose provider=ollama, endpoint=http://localhost:11434/v1

8) Cloud Agent Backend (Production)Use managed Postgres + hosted embeddings/LLM endpoints; scale stateless workers horizontally.Conceptual flow:Managed Postgres (RDS/Cloud SQL/etc.)
N workers polling external_calls (no shared state beyond DB)
App services connect for RAG + observability

9) Batch Ingestion + Retrieval (Knowledge Base / RAG)Treat the system as a durable memory store and retrieval layer for your app.bash

agi ingest --input ./documents

Conceptual flow:Ingest documents into semantic memories
Serve hydrate() / recall() for prompt augmentation

10) Evaluation + Replay Harness (Debuggable Cognition)Use the DB log as an audit trail to test prompts/policies and replay scenarios.sql

-- Inspect recent heartbeats and decisions
SELECT heartbeat_number, started_at, narrative
FROM heartbeat_log
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

11) Tool-Gateway Architecture (Safe Side Effects)Keep the brain in Postgres, but run side effects (email/text/posting) via an explicit outbox consumer.Conceptual flow:Heartbeat queues outreach into outbox_messages
A separate delivery service enforces policy, rate limits, and/or human approval
Delivery service marks messages sent/failed and logs outcomes back to Postgres

Environment ConfigurationCopy .env.local to .env and configure:bash

POSTGRES_DB=agi_db           # Database name
POSTGRES_USER=agi_user       # Database user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agi_password # Database password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost      # Database host
POSTGRES_PORT=5432          # Host port to expose Postgres on (change if 5432 is in use)

If 5432 is already taken (e.g., another local Postgres), set POSTGRES_PORT=5433 (or any free port).Resetting The Database VolumeSchema changes are applied on fresh DB initialization. If you already have a DB volume and want to re-initialize from schema.sql, reset the volume:bash

docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d

TestingRun the test suite with:bash

# Ensure services are up first (passive is enough; tests also use embeddings)
docker compose up -d

# Run tests
pytest test.py -q

Python DependenciesInstall (editable) with dev/test dependencies:bash

pip install -e ".[dev]"

If you’re in a restricted/offline environment and build isolation can’t download build deps:bash

pip install -e ".[dev]" --no-build-isolation

Docker Helper CLIIf you install the package (pip install -e .), you get an agi CLI. If you don’t want to install anything, use the repo wrapper ./agi instead.bash

agi up
agi ps
agi logs -f
agi down
agi init
agi status
agi config show
agi config validate
agi demo
agi chat --endpoint http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3.2
agi ingest --input ./documents
agi start   # docker compose --profile active up -d (runs both workers)
agi stop
agi worker -- --mode heartbeat      # run heartbeat worker locally
agi worker -- --mode maintenance    # run maintenance worker locally
agi mcp

MCP ServerExpose the cognitive_memory_api surface to an LLM/tooling runtime via MCP (stdio).Run:bash

agi mcp
# or: python -m agi_mcp_server

The server supports batch-style tools like remember_batch, connect_batch, hydrate_batch, and a generic batch tool for sequential tool calls.Heartbeat + Maintenance WorkersThe system has two independent background workers with separate triggers:Heartbeat worker (conscious): polls external_calls and triggers scheduled heartbeats (should_run_heartbeat() → start_heartbeat()).
Maintenance worker (subconscious): runs substrate upkeep on its own schedule (should_run_maintenance() → run_subconscious_maintenance()), and can optionally bridge outbox/inbox to RabbitMQ.

The heartbeat worker:polls external_calls for pending LLM work
triggers scheduled heartbeats (start_heartbeat())
executes heartbeat actions and records the result

Turning Workers On/OffYou generally want two modes:Passive / RAG-only: use hydrate()/recall()/remember() without autonomous execution → run no workers
Active / autonomous: process external_calls, run scheduled heartbeats, and do maintenance → run both workers

With Docker Compose:bash

# Default (passive mode): start db + embeddings only
docker compose up -d

# Active mode: start db + embeddings + both workers
docker compose --profile active up -d

# Start only the heartbeat worker
docker compose --profile heartbeat up -d

# Start only the maintenance worker
docker compose --profile maintenance up -d

# Stop the workers (containers stay)
docker compose stop heartbeat_worker maintenance_worker

# Stop + remove the worker containers
docker compose rm -f heartbeat_worker maintenance_worker

# Restart the workers
docker compose restart heartbeat_worker maintenance_worker

# Passive mode: run DB + embeddings only (no workers)
docker compose up -d db embeddings

Pausing From The DB (Without Stopping Containers)If you want the containers running but no autonomous activity, pause either loop in Postgres:sql

-- Pause conscious decision-making (heartbeats)
UPDATE heartbeat_state SET is_paused = TRUE WHERE id = 1;

-- Pause subconscious upkeep (maintenance ticks)
UPDATE maintenance_state SET is_paused = TRUE WHERE id = 1;

-- Resume
UPDATE heartbeat_state SET is_paused = FALSE WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE maintenance_state SET is_paused = FALSE WHERE id = 1;

Note: heartbeats are also gated by agent.is_configured (set by agi init).Running Locally (Optional)You can also run the workers on your host machine (they will connect to Postgres over TCP):bash

agi-worker --mode heartbeat
agi-worker --mode maintenance

Or via the CLI wrapper:bash

agi worker -- --mode heartbeat
agi worker -- --mode maintenance
